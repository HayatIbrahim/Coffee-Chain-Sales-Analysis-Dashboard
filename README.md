# Coffee-Chain-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
I created a comprehensive Coffee Chain Analysis dashboard in Excel, divided into two key sections: Revenue Analysis and Profit Analysis. To bring insights to life, I utilized a wide range of Excel tools and visualization techniques. The dashboard features gauge charts to highlight key performance indicators, key KPI to represent critical data points, and bar charts designed to compare target vs. actual figures. Additionally, I used line charts to display trends over time, waffle charts to represent data proportions, and combo charts that blend both bar and line charts for an in-depth analysis.
The dashboard is powered by advanced Excel formulas and functions, which enable interactive and dynamic reporting. This setup allows for clear and concise communication of financial performance, providing valuable insights into revenue trends and profitability. By combining visual and analytical elements, this dashboard serves as a powerful tool for decision-making in the coffee business.
